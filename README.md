# McKay's Movies
## Initial Concept
This website will provide users with a list of movies and TV series that are currently owned by McKay. 

These are movies and TV series that have been accumulated over the years and are located on VUDU and Apple TV. 

You will need to contact McKay to get the login information to access the movies, but anyone can use the website to see which movies are available for viewing.

## Usage
Anyone can access the website via the url: 

The website will display a list of movies and TV series available for viewing
## Ideas to Implement
- Search bar
- Filter option => filter by name, rating, year, genre, runtime, etc.
- Random button => displays a random movie for the user to watch
- Movie list with alternating views in list or grid view
- Each movie card will have the following information:
  - Movie title with Artwork
  - Rating
  - Year
  - Genre
  - Runtime
  - Main actors

(When clicking on the movie it will load the page which includes more information)
  - Movie title with Artwork
  - Rating
  - Year
  - Genre
  - Runtime
  - Main actors
  - Synopsis
  - IMDB link
  - IMDB parental guide
  - Trailer from YouTube
  - Link to watch movie on VUDU or Apple TV

More ideas, login required
- Add to a list of movies you want to watch, login required
  - This list can be accessed in the user profile
  - Option to search and press a plus button to add to the watch later list
  - Organizing the list in the order the user wants to watch the movies
  - Checkbox function for when a user has watched a movie, keeping the movie on the list or removing it
    - Creating a list of movies they want to watch even if it is not on the master list (That may be difficult because I would need to source an API to get a list of all movies ever)
  - Creating multiple lists (Star Wars, Disney, Horror, 2015, etc.)
- Personal star ratings which can be another option to sort with, login required

Future Ideas
- Submission form for users who want to put a movie on the buy later list. This will create a list for the admin to see what movies people are interested in.

Admin Ideas
- Page to add new movies to list
  - Field for movie name, artwork jpg, rating, year, genre, runtime, IMDB links, YouTube links, etc.
